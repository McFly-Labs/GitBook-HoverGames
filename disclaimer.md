# Disclaimer

## Important must read information  <a href="#important-must-read-information" id="important-must-read-information"></a>

The HoverGames drone development kit (the “KIT”) is for experienced developers above the age of 18 only. CAREFULLY read all information and instructions on this page before assembly and operation of the device.

* NXP provides no software for this circuit board. You are using open source software and programming the flight controller yourself.
* Advanced mechanical and flying skills are a prerequisite for assembling and operating this device. If you are in doubt of your assembly or piloting skills, do not assemble or fly.
* It is your responsibility to inform yourself of and follow all current federal, state, provincial, district and any local laws regarding the use of the drone in the area where you plan to operate it.
* If you choose to modify your drone to function in any autonomous manner, you must ensure that you obtain any required certifications, waivers and licenses and comply fully with local, national and international laws that will apply. It is your responsibility to know what is legal operation.
* It is highly recommended that you have proper liability insurance coverage at all times.
* Your first priority must be the safety of people. Therefore, always keep the drone at a safe distance from people (including yourself!) and follow the provided safety instructions.

### Environmental considerations  <a href="#environmental-considerations" id="environmental-considerations"></a>

* Always fly at locations that are clear of buildings and other obstacles.
* DO NOT fly above or near people or crowds.
* Avoid flying at altitudes above 400 feet (120 m).
* Be certain you are legally allowed to fly in the location and at the altitude you are planning.
* Fly in moderate weather conditions with temperatures between 32 to 104 °F (0 to 40 °C).
* Check all applicable NOTAM and Flight Restrictions in your area. If you don't know what this means, study and educate yourself on the local area aviation rules first. You may need to call and ask a nearby flight control tower before flying.

### Pre-flight checklist  <a href="#pre-flight-checklist" id="pre-flight-checklist"></a>

These are some very important things to check _**before**_** every flight**:

* Ensure you have programmed a motor "kill switch" on the RC transmitter and that it is tested and functioning. How to do this will be [explained in this GitBook](userguide/qgroundcontrol/radio-and-flight-modes.md#flight-modes) as well.&#x20;
* Ensure the remote controller and aircraft batteries are fully charged.
* Ensure the propellers are in good condition and securely tightened.
* Ensure there is nothing obstructing the motors.
* Be sure to calibrate the compass at every new flight location or if the app prompts you.
* Check that the camera lens is clean and free of stains, in case of FPV (First Person View) flight.

Also see the page about [safety](safety.md). Never attach propellers until ready to fly.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**You really should have a "kill switch" programmed!** It is common to have the kill switch immediately stop the motors upon being triggered in order to avoid damage to nearby people or objects. **Setting up a kill switch will be** [**explained in the HG Drone User Guide**](userguide/qgroundcontrol/radio-and-flight-modes.md#flight-modes).
{% endhint %}

### Operation  <a href="#operation" id="operation"></a>

* Stay away from the rotating propellers and motors.
* Maintain line of sight of your aircraft at all times.
* DO NOT answer incoming telephone calls during flight.
* DO NOT fly under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
* In the case of a "Low Battery Warning", land the aircraft as soon as possible at a safe location.
* After landing, first disarm the drone, unplug the flight battery, then turn off the remote controller.

### Insurance <a href="#insurance" id="insurance"></a>

There is also the possibility to insure yourself. It is your own responsibility to find out whether this is required in your location.

* Germany - Pages like [DMO ](https://www.deutsche-modellsport-organisation.de/en/insurances/application.html)offer insurances especially created for drones.
* Americas - AMA and MAAC are two hobby associations that offer insurance for hobby drones (non-commercial use). There are insurers for other usage types.
* Other countries - Contact local drone/hobby flight associations, they should be aware of the best available options.
