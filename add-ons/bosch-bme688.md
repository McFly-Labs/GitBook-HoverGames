 This sensor is pin compatible with the BME680, but with AI built in!
 
 ## Connections 
 The Adafruit BME688 module has two JST SH 4 pin sockets (Also called Qwiic/ Sparkfun QT) for I2C access to the sensor.  
 If you want to use SPI there is pads ready to solder your own connection. Use a piece of header to make it breadboard compatible
