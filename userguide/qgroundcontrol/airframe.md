# Airframe

The HoverGames drone kit includes the LJI X4 500 drone frame. We previously used an S500 drone frame, for which a _S500_ airframe preset was available. Currently, we still use this with the LJI X4 500 frame.

In the _airframe_ screen, under the _Quadrotor X_ configurations, select the _S500_ airframe preset. The QGroundControl user guide provides more information on how you can select this airframe.
