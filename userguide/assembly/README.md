# Assembly

This section is a complete guide on how to build the HoverGames drone with the LJI X4 500 drone frame. It is recommended to read this guide **thoroughly** and **in order**. You should start with mounting the motors, and finish with connecting all wires to the FMU (flight management unit).&#x20;

The guide originally consisted of text and pictures. Videos are now available as well. It is recommended to use the videos together with the written instructions, to make sure you are not missing any information.

Please [contact the HoverGames team](../../contact.md#contact-the-hovergames-team) in case anything is missing, unclear or if you have any feedback.
