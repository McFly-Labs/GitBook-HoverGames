# HG-PX4 Example Lab 2: uORB Publish

In the last lab, we learned what uORB and publish/subscribe protocols were. Then, we wrote a bit of code that allowed us to print out some gyro measurements to the MavLink console! The program we wrote was only half of the equation, though, as we only used the "subscribe" portion of uORB. In this lab, we will publish some data to a topic that will control the RGB LED on the RDDRONE-FMUK66. The topic we are publishing to is subscribed to by an internal PX4 program that handles LED control.

### Includes

As in the last lab, we include our headers to the source code. The headers will be nearly the same, except we will change the **uORB topic** from `sensor_gyro` to `led_control`.

```
#include <px4_platform_common/px4_config.h>
#include <px4_platform_common/posix.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <poll.h>
#include <string.h>

#include <uORB/uORB.h>               // asynchronous messaging API used for inter-thread/inter-process communication
#include <uORB/topics/led_control.h> // uORB for led_control
```

### Main function

As done in the previous lab we create our main function and export it.&#x20;

```
__EXPORT int hg_led_main(int argc, char *argv[]); // Export main for starting in another thread

int hg_led_main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    PX4_INFO("Hello Hovergames LED");
```

Here we export our `hg_led_main` function. Remember, your main function should be called `<filename>_main`. The`PX4_INFO()` function to show text indicating that the program has started.&#x20;

### Setup

A structure is created that we can save LED control data to. This structure will be used to publish the data to the `led_control` uORB topic.

```
    // Create structure to store data in
    struct led_control_s led_control;

    // Clear the structure by filling it with 0s in memory
    memset(&led_control, 0, sizeof(led_control));

    // Create a uORB topic advertisement
    orb_advert_t led_control_pub = orb_advertise(ORB_ID(led_control), &led_control);
```

First step is to create the structure itself. Here, we created an `led_control_s` structure and named it `led_control`. Then, we call `memset()` to fill the structure we created with zeros. We do this because the memory we allocate could have uninitialized random data in it, and in a safety critical platform such as a drone, we don't want to inadvertently send bad data if for some reason our data allocation code fails. The last line of code creates a uORB topic advertisement variable that allows us to **publish to** the `led_control` topic.

### Setting LED control data

Once the initial setup is done, we can now start filling our `led_control` structure with data.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The led\_control uORB message definition can be found in the PX4 source code [here](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/msg/led\_control.msg). This file outlines all of the different parameters than can be set for led\_control.
{% endhint %}

Colors, modes, and priorities can be set using the parameters as described in the link above. In this example, we are going to tell the LED to blink 10 times at max priority with the color green. \
Here's how to do that:

```
    led_control.num_blinks = 10; // Blink 10 times
    led_control.priority = LED_CONTROL_MAX_PRIORITY; // Set our app to max priority
    led_control.mode = LED_CONTROL_MODE_BLINK_NORMAL; // Set the LED mode to blink
    led_control.led_mask = 0xff; // Select all LEDs
    led_control.color = LED_CONTROL_COLOR_GREEN; // Set color to green
```

These parameters are easily set simply by referring to the parameter and giving it a value.&#x20;

* `num_blinks` : We set the number of blinks to 10. You can make this whatever number you want, but don't make it too large or your LED will blink for a very long time!&#x20;
* `priority` : Make our LED app max priority so that something else can't override it by setting `LED_CONTROL_MAX_PRIORITY` . Note that there is are priority levels for a reason. Think carefully about your application as not everything should be max priority.
  * in practice, max priority is reserved for things like error LED sequences.
* `mode` : We set the mode to `LED_CONTROL_MODE_BLINK_NORMAL` for a normal blink sequence.&#x20;
* `led_mask` : We set this to `0xff` which tells the led controller to blink all LEDs. (FYI - This parameter is used in \*some\* custom LED drivers to allow a variety of LEDs to be controlled with uORB message. For example - LEDs located on each of the motor pods that change color in flight to indicate direction of forward travel. Technically it is not fully implemented in the standard PX4 LED driver.
* `color` : Set to `LED_CONTROL_COLOR_GREEN` ! If you'd like to set it to a different color, feel free!

### Publishing our LED data

In order to tell the LED controller to use the parameters we set, we have to send a uORB message with the structure we created. We will use the `orb_publish()` function to do so:

```
    orb_publish(ORB_ID(led_control), led_control_pub, &led_control);
```

And there we have it! Once this command is run, the uORB message with our data will be sent, and our LEDs will start blinking green. \
\
To close out the program, let's print something to the MavLink console that shows our program is done running.

```
    PX4_INFO("Hovergames LED exit");
    
    return 0; // return of main function
    
}
```

### Conclusion

We have now learned how to both subscribe and publish uORB messages in PX4. \
Next, we will create our own program that uses our new found knowledge to manipulate the LED on the RDDRONE-FMUK66.&#x20;
